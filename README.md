## Overview
The goal of this project was to apply our knowledge of the MVC pattern using Ruby on Rails to create a CRUD application with Authentication and Authorization. After my grandfather passed away, I was looking to develop an app that would allow users to focus on the positives of any situation, no matter how gloomy.  This app functions as a simple journaling app where you can also add a checklist of actions to each entry.
